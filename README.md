# sdk-rollup-test-lib

This repo contains a bare-bones example of how to create a library/SDK using Rollup.

If you don't have rollup installed globally, you may need to first run the following:

`npm install -g rollup`

Once you have rollup installed globally (you can check with `rollup -v`), then simply do:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

Tests can be run with `npm run test`.
